## NURBS [Nonuniform Rational B-Splines] Demo

Fully interactive web-based NURBS Surface creation and manipulation, running directly on the browser.

Runs on top of open-source cross-platform NURBS Surface Generator.
(https://github.com/pboyer/verb)

Control-points added for real-time surface manipulation (using THREE.DragControls)

### Demo

### To-Do
Optimizing Geometry computation upon control-point manipulation. Currently, the entire geometry of the mesh is recomputed.
